Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system designed for big data processing and analytics. 
It provides fast, in-memory data processing capabilities, making it ideal for tasks like data mining, 
machine learning, and real-time streaming. Spark supports multiple programming languages, including Java, Scala, Python, and R. 
Its ability to handle large datasets across clusters makes it a popular choice for big data applications.

Here are four key use cases of Apache Spark:

Real-Time Data Processing
Spark Streaming processes real-time data streams, enabling applications like fraud detection, social media sentiment analysis, and live network monitoring.

Machine Learning and AI
With MLlib, Spark powers machine learning tasks such as recommendation systems, predictive analytics, and natural language processing at scale.

Big Data Analytics
Spark efficiently analyzes massive datasets, helping organizations perform tasks like customer segmentation, sales forecasting, and market trend analysis.

IoT (Internet of Things) Applications
Spark processes vast amounts of sensor and device data in real-time, supporting predictive maintenance, smart city initiatives, and connected device ecosystems.
